I'm Faisal. 48 years old. From India.

For around 12 years, I've lived and worked in Saudi Arabia as an expat—long enough to learn that most of what we stress about doesn't matter, and the things that do are simpler than we think. I own and run a couple of businesses as follows.

<a href="https://e8e.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">e8e.dev</a> – A zero-maintenance website development business using static architecture. Fast, secure, reliable websites that don't require maintenance.

<a href="https://ahlanbags.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ahlan Bags</a> – The Exquisite Bag Store. A local business and a trusted destination for stylish, high-quality imported bags in Aurangabad, Maharashtra.

This is my personal brand's home on the internet where I share things that interest me. 

No schedule, no niche, just honest perspectives when something seems worth it.

Thanks for stopping by.
