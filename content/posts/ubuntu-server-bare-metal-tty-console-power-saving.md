This appraoch helps conserve power and prevents OLED/LCD burn-in for an idle display.

---

### üîß Goal

Blank the screen after **1 minute**, then **power down the display after 2 minutes** ‚Äî without affecting any background services like Samba or SSH.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è What I Did

1. **Created the rc.local file** (not available by default in newer Ubuntu versions):

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/rc.local
   ```

2. **Added this line to power-manage the console:**

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   setterm --blank 1 --powerdown 2 < /dev/tty1
   exit 0
   ```

3. **Made it executable:**

   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x /etc/rc.local
   ```

4. **Created a systemd unit to support rc.local:**

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/rc-local.service
   ```

   Paste:

   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=/etc/rc.local Compatibility
   ConditionPathExists=/etc/rc.local
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   Type=forking
   ExecStart=/etc/rc.local start
   TimeoutSec=0
   RemainAfterExit=yes
   GuessMainPID=no

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

5. **Enabled the service:**

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable rc-local
   sudo systemctl start rc-local
   ```

6. **Verified it‚Äôs working:**

   ```bash
   journalctl -u rc-local.service --no-pager
   ```

---

### üß™ Observations

* The screen **goes blank after 1 minute**, powers off after 2.
* It resumes **only on keyboard input**, not trackpad (expected on TTY).
* **SSH, Samba, and all services stay unaffected** ‚Äî only the local screen powers down.
* Confirmed `consoleblank` value:

  ```bash
  cat /sys/module/kernel/parameters/consoleblank
  ```

### ‚úÖ Final Thoughts

This is a clean, GUI-free solution for reducing display wear and power usage on servers with local screens. Great for headless setups, especially laptops, or servers with rarely-used displays.
