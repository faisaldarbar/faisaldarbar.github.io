Just like with Proxmox VE, I prefer a fresh installation and configuration of Proxmox Backup Server (PBS) for a clean and consistent setup. While I would back it up if possible, PBS requires that the machine be either stopped or suspended for backup, meaning it may not be able to back itself up. However, Iâ€™ve heard that one could have another instance of PBS to back up the first.  

Given this, documenting the entire process ensures reproducibility, security, and stability for each installation.

## **1. Installing Proxmox Backup Server (PBS) as a VM on Proxmox VE**  

PBS is a dedicated backup solution for Proxmox environments, offering efficient and secure data storage. In this setup, PBS is installed as a virtual machine (VM) on Proxmox VE.  

### **Installation Steps:**  

1. **Download the ISO**:  
   - Visit the Proxmox Backup Server download page and download the latest ISO.  

2. **Create a New Virtual Machine (VM) in Proxmox VE:**  

   - **General:**  
     - **Name:** pbs 

   - **OS:**  
     - **ISO Image:** Select PBS ISO  

   - **System:**  
     - **Machine:** Q35  
     - **BIOS:** UEFI  
     - **Add EFI Disk:** Checked  
     - **EFI Storage:** local-lvm
     - **Pre-Enroll Keys:** Unchecked
     - **QEMU Agent:** Checked  
     - **SCSI Controller:** VirtIO SCSI Single  

   - **Disks:**  
     - **VirtIO0 (OS):**  
       - **Bus/Device:** VirtIO Block  
       - **Storage:** local-lvm  
       - **Disk Size:** 16GB  
       - **Discard:** Enabled  
     - **SCSI0 (Datastore):**  
       - **Bus/Device:** SCSI  
       - **Storage:** local-lvm  
       - **Disk Size:** 104GB  
       - **Discard:** Enabled  

   - **CPU:**  
     - **Cores:** 2  
     - **Type:** Host  

   - **Memory:**  
     - **Memory:** 4GB - Note: Running Proxmox Backup Server (PBS) with **2 GB RAM** is not recommended due to potential performance issues, slow backups, and increased swap usage. For stability and smooth operation, especially when handling deduplication and indexing, it's best to allocate **4 GB RAM**. Since the VM is only used occasionally and turned off after use, keeping it at **4 GB** ensures reliable performance without unnecessary slowdowns.
     - **Ballooning:** Checked  

   - **Network:**  
     - **Bridge:** vmbr0  
     - **Model:** VirtIO (paravirtualized)  
     - **Firewall:** Checked (Optional - Enable if you need additional network security based on your network setup)  

   - **Confirm:**  
     - Review settings and complete VM creation  

3. **Install PBS**:  
   - Start the VM and proceed with the installation.  
   - Follow the installation wizard and select **ext4** as the filesystem (default).  
   - Set the **FQDN** hostname in the format of your choice. Mine is `hostname.yourdomainname.com`.  
   - Configure the **IP address** and **DNS settings** according to your network setup.  

4. **Complete the Installation**:  
   - Reboot the system and access the PBS web interface.
   - Stop the VM and remove the installation media.
   - Preferably delete the ISO from local (pve) to save space on your disk.
   - Ensure the **boot order** is set correctly in VM options, with the correct virtual disk as the primary boot device.

## **2. Accessing the PBS Web Interface**  

After installation, PBS is managed via a web interface.  

1. Open a browser and navigate to:  
   ```plaintext
   https://<PBS-IP>:8007
   ```
2. Log in using the `root` user and the password set during installation.  

---  

## **3. Configure Repositories**  

Proxmox Backup Server offers enterprise repositories by default, but for non-subscribed users, you should switch to the **pbs-no-subscription** repository to ensure access to the necessary updates without subscription fees.

#### **Enable the pve-no-subscription Repository:**

1. **Use the GUI:**  
   - Navigate to **Datacenter > PBS-VM > Updates > Repositories**.  
   - Disable the **enterprise repository**.  
   - Add a new repository for **pbs-no-subscription**.

2. **Verify via Terminal:**  
   - Open the sources list:
     ```bash
     nano /etc/apt/sources.list
     ```

3. **Ensure the file contains the following:**  
   ```plaintext
   deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian bookworm main contrib

   deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian bookworm-updates main contrib

   # security updates
   deb http://security.debian.org bookworm-security main contrib

   deb http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pbs bookworm pbs-no-subscription
   ```

4. **Save and Close:**  
   - Press `Ctrl+O` to save, `Enter` to confirm, and `Ctrl+X` to exit.

5. **Update the System:**  
   ```bash
   apt update && apt upgrade -y
   ```

## **4. Root User Access in PBS**  

Unlike Proxmox VE, using the `root` user in PBS is necessary for full functionality. Disabling `root` login can cause issues such as:  
- Loss of access to the built-in PBS shell in the web interface.  
- Datastore permission problems.  

Additionally, there is no option in the PBS GUI to create a fully functional PAM userâ€”only PBS-specific users with admin rights.  

For these reasons, **root access should remain enabled** in both SSH and the PBS web interface. However, you can **secure the root user with 2FA**.  

---  

## **5. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for SSH and GUI**  

To enhance security, enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is highly recommended for both SSH and the PBS web GUI.  

### **Enable 2FA for SSH using Google Authenticator**  

1. Install the module:  
   ```bash
   apt install libpam-google-authenticator
   ```  
2. Edit the SSH configuration:  
   ```bash
   nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   ```  
   Ensure these lines are present:  
   ```plaintext
   KbdInteractiveAuthentication yes
   ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes
   UsePAM yes
   ```  
3. Modify the PAM SSH configuration:  
   ```bash
   nano /etc/pam.d/sshd
   ```  
   Add this line at the bottom:  
   ```plaintext
   # PAM SSH configuration for Google Authenticator
   auth required pam_google_authenticator.so
   ```  
4. Restart SSH:  
   ```bash
   systemctl restart sshd
   ```  

### **Configure Google Authenticator**

Now that youâ€™ve enabled 2FA, configure Google Authenticator for your user.

1. Run the following command to set up Google Authenticator:
   ```bash
   google-authenticator
   ```

2. Follow the prompts to:
   - Scan the QR code with the Google Authenticator app on your phone.
   - Save the emergency scratch codes in case you lose access to the app.

### **Enable 2FA for the PBS Web GUI**  

- Navigate to **Configuration > Access Control > Users**.  
- Go to the **2FA tab** and enable Two-Factor Authentication.  
- Follow the steps to set up Google Authenticator, similar to the SSH setup.

## **6. Linking PBS to Proxmox VE (PVE) for Backup**  

Before linking PBS with Proxmox VE, you need to **create a directory in the storage disks and configure it as a datastore**.  

### **Steps to Link PBS with Proxmox VE**  

1. **Create a Datastore**:  
   - On your PBS server, go to **Storage > Directory** and create a directory.  
   - Select the unused disk and format it as **ext4**.  
   - Name it and check the box to **add it as a datastore**.  

2. **Add PBS as a Storage Repository in Proxmox VE**:  
   - In the Proxmox VE web interface, navigate to **Datacenter > Storage**.  
   - Click **Add** and select **Proxmox Backup Server**.  
   - Enter:  
     - **Storage ID** (can be the same as your PBS hostname).  
     - **PBS IP address** as the server.  
     - **PBS root username and password**.  
     - **Datastore name** (e.g., `backup`).  
   - Copy the **Fingerprint** from the PBS web interface dashboard and paste it in Proxmox VE.  

---  

## **7. Manually Backing Up the pfSense VM**  

1. **Manually STOP the pfSense VM from the pfSense console.**
2. **In Proxmox VE:**  
   - Select the stopped **pfSense VM**.  
   - Click **Backup**, then select **Backup Now**.  
   - Choose the PBS storage repository created earlier.  
   - Select **Stop** as the backup mode.  
3. Click **Backup** to initiate the process.   

---  

## **8. Monitoring Backup Status**  

To verify your backups, go to **PBS > Datastore > Backup Datastore** and check for the latest backup entries.  

---
